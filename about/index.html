Over the last 15+ years I've been fortunate to explore many facets of design. It has shaped me into a versatile product designer with an affinity for visual design, but with a generalist mindset.

For as long as I can remember I've loved both the technical and the aesthetic. I have a mind for logic and mathematics but also have a strong appreciation for form and beauty. <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Design</i> has always felt like a natural fit to meets those needs.
</p> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>
I have a background in graphic design and web development, which has given me a solid foundation in visual communication matched with technical skills.
</p> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>
I've worn many hats from web and brand designer to UX and front-end designer. “<i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r><strong data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Digital Product Designer</strong></i>” best describes my generalist mindset and ability to bridge disciplines. I've led end-to-end design projects, facilitated workshops and critiques, presented to clients and stakeholders, mentored junior designers and collaborated closely with developers and product managers. I've worked across marketing and product both for agencies and in-house.
</p> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>
I have a soft spot for efficient design systems, but what excites me most are solutions that go beyond the expected. Thoughtful design that make something not only work well but feels personal.

I've collated some thoughts around design, work and life in general.  I hope they give you some insight into how I think about them and maybe even spark some ideas for your own work.
</p> </div> </div> </div> </section> <section class="c-row c-row--alpha u-pt-eta" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r> <div class="f-grid" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r> <div class="f-col-bp1-4 f-col-bp1-shift-0 f-col-bp3-8 f-col-bp3-shift-2" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r> <div class="c-tile__content c-tile__content--text" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r> <h3 data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Time vs Process</h3> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>
After years in design, one thing has become clear: there's no such thing as a “perfect” process, only the process that fits the time you're given. We always want to do extensive research, endless ideation and interative testing. But in reality, we do not often have the time for it, which means we're constantly balancing <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>time vs process</i>.
</p> <div class="more-text" style="display: none;" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>
The ideal process expects you to start from a place of curiosity and openness. You approach a problem without assumptions and bias. You gather relevant data. You talk to users. You map their journeys, dig into pain points, analyse insights, prototype, test, iterate. It's rigorous, unbiased and rather time-consuming. This is the research-first end of the scale. And when you're lucky enough to operate here, your solutions tend to be more targeted and meaningful. But how often do we actually get that luxury?
</p> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>
More often than not, we're handed tight deadlines, fixed roadmaps, pressure to ship. In those moments we often lean on experience. We assume and make informed decisions. We identify pain points based on past patterns, industry knowledge and sometimes even intuition. We prototype faster, test lighter and ship with an eye on iteration post-shipping. It's not wrong, it's necessary. This is the solution-first end of the scale, where design becomes a strategic act of prioritisation.
</p> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>
The key is recognising that both ends of the scale are valid. They just serve different purposes. Relying on assumptions isn't neccessarily bad design, it's just fast design. But you must be aware of the risks. You might miss nuances, misidentify root causes, or design for the wrong problem. That's the cost of speed. On the other hand, thorough research may give you a better view, but it doesn't guarantee a perfect solution. By taking more time you might lose momentum, stakeholder buy-in, or market relevance. That's the cost of time.
</p> <figure class="u-mt-zeta u-mb-zeta" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r> <img src="/_astro/scale-time-vs-process.AVDPPyoP_mW695.svg" srcset="/_astro/scale-time-vs-process.AVDPPyoP_Z10VoBh.svg 320w, /_astro/scale-time-vs-process.AVDPPyoP_Z1nP6zD.svg 640w, /_astro/scale-time-vs-process.AVDPPyoP_mW695.svg 780w" alt="Time vs Process" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r="true" fetchpriority="auto" width="780" height="500" class="u-height-auto"> </figure> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>
As designers, we should be aware of we are on the scale and align our process to the time and resources we actually have. This means being honest with ourself and the team. If we have a week to redesign a feature, we shouldn't pretend we are running a full discovery sprint. But if we're building something foundational or strategic, we should aim for the time to explore it.
</p> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>
The question I often ask myself at the start of a project isn't “What's the right process?” but rather “<strong data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>With this time given, what can I do <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>well</i>?</strong>” Sometimes that means designing with constraints. Sometimes it means designing at speed. But it always means designing with intention.
</p> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>
Ultimately, great design isn't about following the perfect process, it's about making the good choices within the constraints you're given. That's the craft. And over time, what separates <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>experienced</i> designers from the rest isn't how much they do, but how well they balance the scale between time and process.
</p> </div> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r><a href="#" class="c-link show-more" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Show more</a></p> </div> </div> </div> </section> <section class="c-row c-row--alpha u-pt-eta" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r> <div class="f-grid" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r> <div class="f-col-bp1-4 f-col-bp1-shift-0 f-col-bp3-8 f-col-bp3-shift-2" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r> <div class="c-tile__content c-tile__content--text" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r> <h3 data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>It's in the<i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>m</i> details</h3> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>
I've been thinking about what got me into design and more importantly what keeps me excited about design and I realise it's somewhat contradictory. At one hand the strategic problem-solving part excites me. Understanding the problem, shaping a solution, aligning with business goals (well, most of the time 😏)... This is the foundation and without it design might as well be just decoration. Getting the direction right is what makes everything else possible.
</p> <div class="more-text" style="display: none;" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>
But even when the strategy is solid, what really gives me pride and satisfaction is often the details. Having the time to create a micro-interaction that is surprising and thoughtfull or a smooth transition that makes a user flow feel natural. I sometimes find myself admiring copy that is just so on point or that is feels brilliantly clever. Those things might seem futile and are often overlooked, but for me they are the difference between something that works and something that resonates.

A few years ago, I had a colleague everyone saw as a hard worker. They were always early, always busy, always <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>putting in the hours</i>. Eventually, they were reassigned to the support team, handling client issues. It felt like a demotion for them, the effort they put in seemed overlooked. But from management's perspective, the picture was different. While this person executed tasks well, their impact beyond simply “getting work done” was actually quite limited. It made me realise that working hard and having impact are not the same.
</p> <div class="more-text" style="display: none;" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>
There are stretches where I am moving a lot of work, churning through tasks, putting my everything in it and sometimes I am mentally drained at the end of the day. The quantity of output might be high, but the actual impact is surprisingly small. The product and the business have not shifted, my design approach is not meaningfully better. And even though I might have a brief sense of accomplishment, ultimately I feel like I'm stagnating.

But then there are other moments that feel almost effortless. A conversation that reframes a problem. An idea I have that simplifies a process. A design insight that changes how the team thinks. None of these things are considered hard work, but the ripple effect is enormous. My work and therefor my motivation improves in ways that matter. The team finds clarity and the business feels the benefit. And often I end the day more energised than when I started.
</p> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>
Ultimately if find (Design) work is not measured in hours spent, but in impact created. Sometimes impact comes from relentless execution, but more often it comes from finessing the process, paying attention where you are in the design chain and trying to improve it. <strong data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>I remind myself to care less about being busy and more about having impact.</strong> </p> </div> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r><a href="#" class="c-link show-more" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Show more</a></p> </div> </div> </div> </section> <section class="c-row c-row--alpha u-pt-eta u-pt-eta" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r> <div class="f-grid" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r> <div class="f-col-bp1-4 f-col-bp1-shift-0 f-col-bp3-8 f-col-bp3-shift-2" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r> <div class="c-tile__content c-tile__content--text" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r> <h3 data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r><i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>TMM</i>: Too Many Meetings</h3> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>
I'm yet too <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>meet</i> a person who does not have a love/hate relationship with meetings. They are one of the most common rituals in the workplace, yet they are also one of the most disruptive.
</p> <div class="more-text" style="display: none;" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>
On the positive side meetings can align teams quickly. They allow for nuance that Slack or e-mail cannot capture, like tone and body language. Good meetings accelerate decisions, clarify priorities and creates a shared sense of accountability. When ideas are complex a well-structured meeting or workshop can be the best way align on ideas.
</p> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>
But the other side is harder to ignore. Meetings often disrupt people's deep focus required for design or dev work. An ad hoc or poorly scheduled meeting can be detrimental to a productive day, leaving you behind with a scattered brain and unfinished work. Lots of meetings also have too many attendees, lack an agenda or rehash discussions that could have been resolved async. Those meetings are not just inefficient but also frustrating.
</p> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r> <strong data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>So are meetings a necessary evil?</strong> Perhaps. They are necessary in that human collaboration requires dialogue. But they become evil when they multiply without clear purpose.
</p> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>
Over time, I've learned a few actions that help tip the balance:
</p> <ul data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r> <li data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r><strong data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Use other channels</strong>. Ask yourself if a meeting is actually the right channel. Can I gather information async (eg. Slack polls, async design critique, email, etc)</li> <li data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r><strong data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Protect rhythm</strong>. Agree with your team to cluster meetings to allow for long stretches of deep-focus work.</li> <li data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r><strong data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Come prepared</strong>. A clear agenda with supporting visuals or resources allows for clarity on scope. If you require anyone to bring or prepare anything, let them know beforehand.</li> <li data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r><strong data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Keep it lean</strong>. Invite only those people who are essential to the decision your are after.</li> <li data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r><strong data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Close with actions</strong>. Every meeting should end with everyone knowing what to do and by when.</li> </ul> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>
Meetings will never disappear and nor should they. But if we treat them as a design problem, optimizing for clarity and outcomes, we may finally learn to use them as the tool they are intended to be.
</p> </div> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r><a href="#" class="c-link show-more" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Show more</a></p> </div> </div> </div> </section> <section class="c-row c-row--alpha u-pt-eta u-pb-eta" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r> <div class="f-grid" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r> <div class="f-col-bp1-4 f-col-bp1-shift-0 f-col-bp3-8 f-col-bp3-shift-2" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r> <div class="c-tile__content c-tile__content--text" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r> <h3 data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Explore alone, grow together</h3> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>
As an introvert, some of my best work starts in silence. Just me, a problem to untangle and enough space to let ideas take shape. Yet I find that learning and growing often happens collectively and the best ideas are rarely born in isolation.
</p> <div class="more-text" style="display: none;" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>
Sharing an insight in a stand-up, posting an interesting resource or book in the team chat via Slack, or even a half-baked thought whilst chatting with a colleague can be so electric. This collective learning sparks creativity and often alters my way of thinking.
</p> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>
Though I try to steer away from the classic "<i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>too many cooks in the kitchen</i>" syndrome. Large teams and/or many stakeholders that slow down progress and destroy decision making.  That's why I prefer small, lean teams where everyone's contribution counts whilst autonomy and collaboration work in synergy.
</p> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>
Therefor my ideal scenario is simple. <strong data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Time alone to explore, paired with the right moments of teamwork to learn from others, refine ideas and expand them beyond what I could do by myself.</strong> Autonomy stays at the core, but sharing ideas invites collective learning and ensures that my work never gets stuck in my own perspective.
